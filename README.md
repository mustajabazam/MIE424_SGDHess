# MIE424_SGDHess
This repository consists of the code for the MIE424 final project. 

# Topic
We implement the SGD with Hessian-corrected momentum optimizer algorithm. 
The main contribution of this project/repository is to extend the results from a classification task (as in the original SGDHess paper), to a Reinforcement Learning environment. 
We implement the Actor-Critic framework, and test this SGDHess optimizer on multiple complex environments available within Mujoco (e.g. Walker2d, Hopper, Ant, and Humanoid). 
We compare and contrast the performance of SGDHess against other commonly used optimizers across all these environments.
